Hi Aboo,

   It is a great honour to hear from you!
   And I am very miss you though we just Separated this morning.
   In fact ,I do not get angry last eveningï¼Œperhaps if I were you I also feel bored of myself.
   You loves me I can feel,and you does not love me I can feel too.
   You are not wrong but I am not wrong,too.
   In fact, every time you make me feel unhappy, I feel you do not love me a little,every time it is.
   I don't want you to give me the feeling that you don't love me at the end unless you do not love me or you do not want to marry me.
   Love is about to cherish. Nothing is permanent if you do not cherish.
   
   yous love,
   LittleJun
